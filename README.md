![anderson — digital-rain intro: the agents review the agents](assets/anderson-demo.gif)

**Four Claude subagents that plan, grill, implement, and review each other — with two human gates, because green ≠ understood.**

**anderson** is a [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) plugin: a gated maker/checker pipeline that turns one task into a reviewed, shipped pull request. Each stage runs as its own subagent at its own model + effort, state lives on disk, and **two unconditional human gates** mean nothing merges without your eyes on it.

## Why

- **Roles, not one mega-prompt.** A planner plans, a separate reviewer critiques it, an implementer builds, an *independent* reviewer checks the diff. The maker never grades its own homework.
- **You stay in the loop.** Two human gates (after plan-review, after diff-review) halt unconditionally — even on a `ship` verdict. Plus an interactive **grill** step that interrogates the plan *before* any code is written.
- **Self-contained.** The agent logic is inlined — no external skills to install. Per-stage `model` + `effort` switch automatically.
- **Ships for real.** Approving the diff branches, commits, pushes, and opens the PR — guarded, so it degrades gracefully without a remote / `gh`. Runs headless in CI too.

## The pipeline

```
plan ─▶ grill ─▶ plan_review ──[ YOU ]──▶ implement ─▶ diff_review ──[ YOU ]──▶ ship
```

|     | Stage         | Persona                  | Model · effort  | Gate          | What happens                                                                                       |
| --- | ------------- | ------------------------ | --------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🏛  | `plan`        | THE ARCHITECT            | opus · high     | —             | drafts `plan.md`                                                                                   |
| 🕶  | `grill`       | THE INTERROGATOR · *you* | — (human)       | 🛑 human      | interrogates the plan one question at a time; your answers harden it                               |
| 🔮  | `plan_review` | THE ORACLE               | opus · xhigh    | 🛑 **GATE 1** | edits the plan inline + appends review to `## 🔭 Review`; verdict `ship` / `fix_first` / `regrill` |
| 🟢  | `implement`   | NEO                      | sonnet · medium | —             | writes the code + `audit.md`                                                                       |
| 🕴  | `diff_review` | AGENT SMITH              | opus · xhigh    | 🛑 **GATE 2** | independent, read-only diff review                                                                 |
| 🔑  | `ship`        | THE ONE                  | —               | —             | branch `anderson/<slug>` + commit + push + PR, scratch cleaned                                     |

`regrill` loops plan-review back to **grill**; `fix_first` loops the implementer (capped by `max_iterations`). Both gates halt unconditionally, even on a `ship` verdict.

## auto mode — the autonomous pipeline

`/anderson:auto <task-id> <title> [body|@taskspec-file]` runs the **same four subagents end-to-end with no human halts**. The two interactive gates are replaced by independent adversarial agent panels plus an objective CI gate; it produces a **draft PR** for you to merge. Experimental — review the PR carefully.

Plus:

- **Override policy (operator opt-in).** auto pushes through the soft guardrails to *finish the task* (low planner confidence, scope/runaway caps, sensitive non-migration paths). **Two hard rules never bend:** it **never authors or applies a migration** (hard stop + hand-off) and **never force-pushes any branch but its own** `anderson/auto/*` (squash-to-clean on its own branch only).
- **Difficulty routing.** A tier from the plan's Scorecard, re-derived from the actual diff size (escalate-only), sizes the plan gate, the panel size, the panel model, and the arbiter — so a one-line fix doesn't pay for a 3-opus panel.
- **Verification hardening.** RED red-for-right-reason, content-hash tamper guard, full-suite-no-new-failures vs baseline, flake re-runs, and blind reviewers.
- **Error handling & open questions.** The plan enumerates the failure paths the change touches and classes each `deduced` (handle it now) or `needs-context` (a business call the code can't make). With no human to grill, auto captures the `needs-context` ones into a **## ❓ Open questions & assumptions** PR section, flags the PR `needs-human`, and adds `open_q=<n>` to the `metrics:` line — it ships the question, never an invented answer.
- **Safety rails.** Draft PR only; branch only (its own worktree is the sandbox); baseline-green precondition; dependency/secret-path edits flagged `needs-human`.
- **Terminal states.** SHIP (`stage: done`, draft PR opened) or abort (`stage: aborted` + a structured `feature-research/<task-id>/report.md`).

## Quickstart

```
/plugin marketplace add amj-lang/anderson
/plugin install anderson@dodge-this
# restart Claude Code fully (not just /reload), then:
/anderson:start demo "build a live dashboard widget that pulls status from the top 5 AI companies' status pages"
```

Drive the gates in plain text — "approved, go" / "ship it" / "rework the blockers" — or with `/anderson:approve-plan`, `:approve-diff`, `:rework`, `:status`. Run `/anderson:demo` for a zero-token dry-run of the full pipeline.

## Commands

All commands are namespaced `/anderson:<command>` — bare `/anderson` does not resolve. They take **positional arguments** — the first word is the `<slug>` / `<task-id>` (the on-disk state-dir key), the rest is the goal/title — plus one optional flag: **`--fable`** on `start` / `auto` (place it at the end). It runs the two critique gates (plan-review + diff-review/arbiter) on **Fable** instead of Opus — the stronger critical analyst — while the generative stages (planner, implementer) stay on Opus/Sonnet. The choice persists in `state.md`, so it carries across `approve-plan` / `rework`. Every command just reads the same `feature-research/<slug>/state.md`, so once a flow is running you can also drive it in plain text ("approved, go" / "ship it" / "rework the blockers").

| Command        | Invoke                                           | What it does                                                                                                                                                               | When to use                                            |

| `start`        | `/anderson:start <slug> <goal> [--fable]`        | **Entry point** (gated). Seeds state, plans, **grills you** one question at a time, plan-reviews. Halts at 🛑 Gate 1. `--fable` → review gates on Fable.                    | Begin any gated task.                                  |
| `approve-plan` | `/anderson:approve-plan <slug>`                  | Pass Gate 1 → implement + independent diff-review. Halts at 🛑 Gate 2.                                                                                                     | After you've read `plan.md` + `## 🔭 Review`.          |
| `approve-diff` | `/anderson:approve-diff <slug>`                  | Pass Gate 2 = **SHIP**: branch + commit + push + PR (all guarded), clean scratch. Never force-pushes.                                                                      | After you've read the diff + review.                   |
| `rework`       | `/anderson:rework <slug>`                        | Loop the implementer on the "Still open" blockers only, then re-review. Back to Gate 2. Bounded by `max_iterations`.                                                       | Diff review returned `fix_first`.                      |
| `status`       | `/anderson:status <slug>`                        | Dashboard: stage, next agent + model/effort, both verdicts, iteration vs max, model-override check. Read-only.                                                             | Check where a run is, or resume later.                 |
| `demo`         | `/anderson:demo`                                 | Zero-token dry-run: prints every stage banner + both gate lines. No agents, no files.                                                                                      | Preview the UX before a real run.                      |
| `auto`         | `/anderson:auto <task-id> <title> [body\|@file] [--fable]` | **Autonomous** end-to-end → draft PR, no human gates (see [auto mode](#auto-mode--the-autonomous-pipeline)). `body` is optional inline text or `@path` to a TaskSpec file; `--fable` → review gates on Fable. | Well-scoped, unattended fixes you'll review at the PR. |

**Our suggestions.** First-timers: run `/anderson:demo` to see the whole flow for free. For everyday work drive the gated loop `start → approve-plan → approve-diff` (with `rework` between gates as needed) — the two human gates are the point. Reach for `auto` only when the task is well-scoped **and** the suite is green; always review its draft PR. For CI / walk-away runs use the flag-driven headless runner `bin/feature.sh` (`start` / `--approve-plan` / `--approve-diff` / `--rework`) — see [Headless / CI](#headless--ci).

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) with plugin support.
- For the ship step: `git`, a remote, and the [`gh`](https://cli.github.com) CLI authenticated (degrades gracefully without them).

## Headless / CI

`plugins/anderson/bin/feature.sh` runs the same pipeline deterministically, exiting at each gate (codes 10/20) so it composes with CI or a Makefile — and `--approve-diff` ships the PR.

## More

- **Full operator docs** — models/effort verification, autonomous chaining, terminal flair, troubleshooting: **[plugins/anderson/README.md](plugins/anderson/README.md)**.
- **auto mode (experimental)** — non-halting end-to-end pipeline to a draft PR: `/anderson:auto <task-id> <title>`. See the "auto mode" subsection in [plugins/anderson/README.md](plugins/anderson/README.md) and the spec at [plugins/anderson/docs/auto-mode.md](plugins/anderson/docs/auto-mode.md).
- **CI** ([`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)) runs scheduler unit tests, `py_compile`, shellcheck (advisory), and version-sync enforcement; on push to `main` it auto-creates a `vX.Y.Z` tag + GitHub release when `plugin.json` carries a new version.
