![anderson — digital-rain intro: the agents review the agents](assets/anderson-demo.gif)

**Four Claude subagents that plan, grill, implement, and review each other — with two human gates, because green ≠ understood.**

anderson is a [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) plugin: a gated maker/checker pipeline that turns one task into a reviewed, shipped pull request. Each stage runs as its own subagent at its own model + effort, state lives on disk, and **two unconditional human gates** mean nothing merges without your eyes on it.

## Why

- **Roles, not one mega-prompt.** A planner plans, a separate reviewer critiques it, an implementer builds, an *independent* reviewer checks the diff. The maker never grades its own homework.
- **You stay in the loop.** Two human gates (after plan-review, after diff-review) halt unconditionally — even on a `ship` verdict. Plus an interactive **grill** step that interrogates the plan *before* any code is written.
- **Self-contained.** The agent logic is inlined — no external skills to install. Per-stage `model` + `effort` switch automatically.
- **Ships for real.** Approving the diff branches, commits, pushes, and opens the PR — guarded, so it degrades gracefully without a remote / `gh`. Runs headless in CI too.

## Pipeline

```
plan ─▶ grill ─▶ plan_review ──[ YOU ]──▶ implement ─▶ diff_review ──[ YOU ]──▶ ship
high    [ YOU ]  xhigh                    medium       xhigh            commit + PR
                                    ▲            │ fix_first / rework
                                    └────────────┘
```

| Stage         | Who             | Model / effort  | Gate  | Does                                             |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------|
| plan          | `planner`       | opus / high     | —     | writes `plan.md`                                 |
| grill         | **you**         | — (human)       | human | relentless one-at-a-time Q&A; folds decisions in |
| plan_review   | `plan-reviewer` | opus / xhigh    | human | edits the plan; verdict `ship`/`fix_first`/`regrill` |
| implement     | `implementer`   | sonnet / medium | —     | writes the code + `audit.md`                     |
| diff_review   | `reviewer`      | opus / xhigh    | human | independent read-only diff review                |
| ship          | —               | —               | —     | branch + commit + push + PR                      |

`regrill` loops plan-review back to grill; `fix_first` loops the implementer (capped by `max_iterations`).

## The cast

| Persona          | Stage         | Role                          |
|------------------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| THE ARCHITECT    | `plan`        | drafts the plan               |
| THE INTERROGATOR | `grill`       | you — grills the plan         |
| THE ORACLE       | `plan_review` | sharpens the plan             |
| NEO              | `implement`   | writes the code               |
| AGENT SMITH      | `diff_review` | hunts for what's wrong        |
| THE ONE          | `ship`        | commits + opens the PR        |

## Quickstart

```
/plugin marketplace add amj-lang/anderson
/plugin install anderson@dodge-this
# restart Claude Code fully (not just /reload), then:
/anderson:start brief-views "normalize briefs_table.views[] into brief_views_table"
```

Drive the gates in plain text — "approved, go" / "ship it" / "rework the blockers" — or with `/anderson:approve-plan`, `:approve-diff`, `:rework`, `:status`.

## What a run looks like

1. 🏛 **THE ARCHITECT** (`plan`) — `/anderson:start <slug> "<goal>"` drafts `plan.md`.
2. 🕶 **THE INTERROGATOR** (`grill`) — *you* — interrogates the plan one question at a time; your answers harden it.
3. 🔮 **THE ORACLE** (`plan_review`) — reviews + edits the plan → **GATE 1** (you approve).
4. 🟢 **NEO** (`implement`) writes the code → 🕴 **AGENT SMITH** (`diff_review`) hunts the diff for what's wrong → **GATE 2** (you approve).
5. 🔑 **THE ONE** (`ship`) — branch `anderson/<slug>` + commit + push + PR. Scratch cleaned. Done.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) with plugin support.
- For the ship step: `git`, a remote, and the [`gh`](https://cli.github.com) CLI authenticated (degrades gracefully without them).

## Headless / CI

`plugins/anderson/bin/feature.sh` runs the same pipeline deterministically, exiting at each gate (codes 10/20) so it composes with CI or a Makefile — and `--approve-diff` ships the PR.
